•HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. It uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other media. HTML documents begin with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and are divided into `<head>` and `<body>` sections, where the `<head>` contains meta-information and the `<body>` contains the visible content.

•CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It separates content from design by defining styles for HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS rules are composed of selectors and declarations, and can be applied inline, internally within `<style>` tags, or externally via linked `.css` files.
•JavaScript
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language used to create interactive and responsive web pages. It runs on the client side and can manipulate the DOM to update content, validate forms, handle events, and create animations. JavaScript supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming paradigms, making it versatile for a wide range of applications. It can also be used server-side with environments like Node.js.
